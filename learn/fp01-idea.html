        <h1>Idea?</h1>
        <h2>What is my idea for this website?</h2>
        <p>My starting idea is a hobby website about skating (ice skating, roller skating, skateboarding)</p>
    
        <h2>Why am I choosing this idea?</h2>
        <p>I'm choosing this idea because of my recent interest in ice skating. I want to share what I've been learning and the skills ive been working on.</p>
    
        <h2>Target Audience?</h2>
        <p>My target audience will be anyone who might have some level of interest on beginning skating at all. It could also gain the attention of experienced skaters also.</p>
    
        <h2>What do I want to accompish?</h2>
        <p>I think with this website, I want to cement in solid form the improvement I am making on my hobbies. I originally started ice skating as a way of finding hobbies that would deviate from my nerd-like nature, and as I grew more interested in the subject, I wanted to see myself succeed and be proud of the skills I cultivated. </p>
        <p>This website will put that in physical form!üòÅ</p>
